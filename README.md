# Lazurite

## Building the Project

The project compiles with Visual Studio 2017. Ensure you have windows SDK 10.0.17763.0. 

## Goals
I use Lazurite as a playground for testing the implementation of common techniques and patterns in game development.
By no means is it an engine I would use to build a game, it's likely full of performance issues I haven't taken into
consideration. If you decide you want to get the code running and somehow do (See above) you do so at your own risk, I'm
not liable if your computer grows legs and jumps off of your balcony as a side effect of executing this built code.

Currently I'm playing with the following
* Component based architecture
* Scene graphs
* Physics integration
* Shading
